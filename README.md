# pp-lib

The Playdate-Platformer Library is a library to make creating a platformer game for the playdate easy, while including all the things that make jumping feel good.

# Quick start

# Adding new states

# API

---

## Actor

extends `playdate.graphics.sprite`

a very thin wrapper around `playdate.graphics.sprite`, mostly because I prefer calling things 'actors' insted of 'sprites' ðŸ¤·

### `Actor:init()`

also calls `self:add()`

### `Actor:destroy()`

calls `self:remove()`

---

## Solid

extends `Actor`

extend this class to create blocks/platforms that you want you player to be able to stand on.

### `Solid:init()`

sets its group to `{Group.solid}`

### `Solid:setSidePassthrough(side, passable)`

- `side`: `Side.top`, `Side.bottom`, `Side.left`, or `Side.right`. bitwise or can be used to set multiple sides at once `Side.left | Side.right`
- `passable`: boolean, if the player is able to passthrough coming from that direction.
  you may also set the mask directly, `solid.mask = Side.top`, this has the effect of setting all sides except that one being passable.

### `Solid.addEmptyCollisionSprite(x, y, w, h)`

utility function to add an invisible solid to the game

---

## Trigger

extends `Actor`

a catch all class for everything that interacts with the player but doesn't stop them, eg: pickups, coins, spikes, enemies, etc.

### `Trigger:init()`

sets its group to `{Group.trigger}`

### `Trigger:perform(actor, col)`

to be overridden, is called when this object overlaps with the player

- `actor`: the player actor
- `col`: the [collision object](https://sdk.play.date/1.13.7/#m-graphics.sprite.moveWithCollisions)

---

## DefaultPlatformer

extends `BasePlatformer`
A good starting place for most platformers, sets up sensible defaults for all values and sets up the state machine.
Sub class this class to create your platformer character.

### `DefaultPlatformer:init(images, options)`

- `images`:`{idle=[image or imagetable], run=[image or imagetable], jump=[image or imagetable], fall=[image or imagetable]}`. The images to be used for each of the different states, under the hood it uses [AnimatedImage](https://github.com/mierau/playdate-animatedimage).
- `options`:`{idle=[AnimatedImage options], run=[AnimatedImage options], jump=[AnimatedImage options], fall=[AnimatedImage options]}`
  - options for each of the different images, as per [AnimatedImage](https://github.com/mierau/playdate-animatedimage)
    - `delay`: time in milliseconds to wait before moving to next frame. (default: 100ms)
    - `paused`: start in a paused state. (default: false)
    - `loop`: loop the animation. (default: false)
    - `step`: number of frames to step. (default: 1)
    - `sequence`: an array of frame numbers in order to be used in the animation e.g. `{1, 1, 3, 5, 2}`. (default: all of the frames from the specified image table)

initalises the state machine like this:

```
self.sm:addState("idle", IdleState(self, images.idle, options.idle))
self.sm:addState("run", RunState(self, images.run, options.run))
self.sm:addState("jump", JumpState(self, images.jump, options.jump))
self.sm:addState("fall", FallState(self, images.fall, options.fall))

self.sm:addEvent({name='run', from='*', to='run'})
self.sm:addEvent({name='stop', from='run', to='idle'})
self.sm:addEvent({name='jump', from='*', to='jump'})
self.sm:addEvent({name='fall', from='*', to='fall'})
self.sm:addEvent({name='land', from='fall', to=defaultLandEvent})

self.sm:addCallback('onland', defaultOnLandCallback)
self.sm:addCallback('onbeforefall', defaultOnBeforeFallCallback)
self.sm:addCallback('onbeforejump', defaultOnBeforeJumpCallback)
```

## BasePlatformer

extends `Actor`

A bare bone starting point for a platformer. Initalises the statemachine but does not add any states or events.
Does not initalise any parameters.
Sub class this class to create your platformer character.

### `BasePlatformer.sm`

the players state machine

### `BasePlatformer.inputs`

the players input handler

### `BasePlatformer:init()`

Initalises the statemachine but does not add any states or events.
Does not initalise any parameters.
Adds the player to the `{Group.actor}` group, and sets collidesWithGroups to `{Group.solid, Group.trigger}`

### `BasePlatformer:update()`

performs the following thins in order:

1. calls `update` on the input handler
2. calls `update` on the current state
3. calls `move` on self
4. calls `updateImageFlip` on self

### `BasePlatformer:collisionResponse()`

returns `kCollisionTypeSlide` if othe is fully solid, otherwise returns `kCollisionTypeOverlap`

### `BasePlatformer:move()`

performs the following thins in order:

1. moves the player with collisions
2. calls `resolveCollision` on all `Solid`s collided with
3. calls `perform` on all `Trigger`s collided with
4. calls `aftermove` on the current state
5. calls `aftermove` on self

### `BasePlatformer:aftermove(cols, l, tx, ty)`

- `cols`: [collision objects](https://sdk.play.date/1.13.7/#m-graphics.sprite.moveWithCollisions)
- `l`: number of collisions
- `tx`: target x
- `ty`: target y

called after all movement resolutions are done
override if you want to do something here

---

## InputHandler

all input management is handled her to create a seperation of concerns and to make changing the controll scheme easy

### `InputHandler:update(buttons, actor)`

must set the following parametes

- `dx`: the horozontal direction, a number between -1 and 1 (usually -1, 0, or 1)
- `jump`: boolean, jump button held down
- `jump_pressed`: boolean, jump button just pressed
- `jump_buffered`: boolean, jump button pressed with in the last n ms (the `jump_buffer_time` set on the actor)

---

## Machine

the state machine based on [this one](https://github.com/kyleconroy/lua-state-machine) without the async transitions and some extra utility added.

### `Machine:addState(name, state)`

adds a state to the state machine, if it is the first state added, will also set it as the initial state

### `Machine:addEvent(event)`

event is a table with the values:

- `name`: the name of the event, a method will be added to the state maching allowing you to trigger this event. Additional arguments will be passed to the `onenter` method of the state. eg: `sm:run()`
- `from`: either a string or a list of strings, the states this event can be triggered from. If this event is triggered while the current state isn't part of this list, nothing happens. `'*'` may be used to allow the event from all states.
- `to`: either a string, the name of the state to enter, or a function that returns the name of the state to enter. The function is passed the args `{[Machine], [event name], [from]}`

### `addCallback([name], [callback])`

adds a callback function to be on or before a given event

- `name`: either `'on'..[event name]`, `'onbefore'..[event name]`, or `'onstatechange'`
- `callback`: function to be called, args passed `{ [Machine], name, from, to, ...}`

### `Machine:current()`

returns the current state object

### `Machine:get([name])`

returns the state object of that name
